Performance Tuning

    This solution attempts to find a happy medium between memory consumption,
logic freshness, application responsiveness, and file system I/O.  However,
performance will largely depend on how the application is used, and the settings
might need to be adjusted to ensure optimum performance.

* Tuning Memory Usage

    There are a lot of ways to configure memory management in Ehcache.  So
many, in fact, that it's probably better just to look at
{{{http://ehcache.org/documentation/configuration/cache-size} Ehcache's
documentation on cache sizing}} than mention them here.

    It's important to choose the right settings for cache memory usage. If the
cache is too small, then items will be evicted often, which can negatively
affect performance by increasing disk I/O as items must be loaded from the file
system more frequently (calls to &lt;&lt;&lt;SelfPopulatingCache.get()&gt;&gt;&gt; will block
while the item is being loaded from the file system).  If the cache is too
large, then there will be less heap space available to the rest of the
application, and performance could be negatively affected due to more
frequent/thorough garbage collection (or worse, your application could start
throwing &lt;&lt;&lt;OutOfMemoryError&gt;&gt;&gt;s).

* Tuning I/O

    Periodically polling the file system introduces some amount of disk I/O
at regular intervals.  Our solution attempts to minimise the impact by only
polling directories containing files for which we have valid cache entries.  I/O
performance can be tuned by changing the polling intervals for the file system
monitor and the cache expiration monitor, as well as carefully choosing where on
the file system to place scripts.

    Suggestions for tuning I/O:

    * Choose a file system polling interval based on how &quot;fresh&quot; you want the
logic to be.  A short polling interval introduces unnecessary I/O,
especially when the files don't change very often.  Too long a polling interval,
and your users might be using stale logic, or they might have to wait a while
after a script is updated before using a particular feature.

    * Choose a cache expiration timeout (&lt;&lt;&lt;timeToIdleSeconds&gt;&gt;&gt;) based on
user demand for cached logic.  Too short a timeout, and you will see a
performance impact on frequently-accessed application functions, since the
application must constantly wait for the logic to be loaded from the file
system.  A long timeout increases the amount of unnecessary I/O due to
file system polling for scripts which are no longer being used by the
application.

    * Choose a cache expiration polling interval based on what you consider to
be an acceptable amount of unnecessary file system polling.  A longer polling
interval increases the amount of unnecessary I/O for objects which are used
infrequently, as they are more likely to expire.  A shorter polling interval
can increase the amount of time it takes to retrieve a valid entry from the
cache due to shared resource contention (Ehcache tries to minimise this as
much as it can, but the impact is still there, however small it might be).

    * Consider the deployment environment when deciding where to place script
files.  Locally-attached storage tends to have better read performance than
network-attached storage.  Some file systems can be very slow to list a
directory's contents if there are lots of files in the directory (this is
noticeably slow in SMB shares with several thousand files in them - not uncommon
in enterprise environments).  Should every script be placed in the same
directory, or would you see a performance boost by splitting them up into
different directories?  If so, how should they be split up to maximise I/O
performance?  These questions can only be correctly answered by evaluating how
the application is deployed and how it is being used; they do not have
one-size-fits-all answers.
